# FATExDAO-Bounties
The FATExDAO Bounty program is for the community to take part in the development of the FATExDAO Ecosystem. Both technical and non-technical bounties can be added.

# Introduction:
If you have a bug or an idea, browse the open issues before opening a new one. You can also take a look at the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/).

Each FATExDAO bounty will state a clear definition of the goal, requirements, acceptance criteria, and rewards (stated below).

All bounties will be listed in the [Issues](https://github.com/FATExDAO/FATExDAO-Bounties/issues) tab.

# How to participate:
Read access is granted to github users for this repository. You may submit a bounty specification by adding a new issue. You may also browse open issues and select  reward based bounties to complete.

For detailed instructions on how to create and participate in issues please review the [Github Issues Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) before asking questions.

# FATExDAO Bounty Reward Details & Additional Options:
The bounty for the winner will be 0.5% of total FATE supply (4,444,444 tokens). Bounty payment will be structured as follows: (to ensure FATE price growth and prevent "dumping")

**Bounty winner will have 1 of 2 options for bounty prize payout:**

Paid in xFATE and locked for 6 months (generating compounding income from DEX fees) - released weekly after 6-months - 50% immediately - the remainder will be released at a steady, weekly rate of 10% from original prize amount.

Paid in FATE 10% of the bounty will go to the winner immediately.  The remainder will be paid out weekly at a rmax. Rate of 4% a week after a 30 day locking period.  Winner can choose to reduce the weekly percent pay-out and will receive an equally matched percent bonus on the entire amount of the bounty. (i.e. if the winner chooses to be paid at a rate of 2% before weekly pay-out starts, they will receive an additional 2% bonus). Winner can adjust payout percent up and down per week, any adjustment downward will be met with an equal percent bonus on the remaining pay-out amount.  Any adjustment upwards (to the max of 4% per week) will not impact the pay-out or existing bonus.  This winner-choice percent will accumulate in an xFATE pool and be paid out in bulk after the original amount is paid out.

**Note:**
Winner may negotiate a better reward structure if it is focused on hodling FATE longer (focused on long term growth of FATE value, which is the fundamental point of the bounty).

If the winner chooses to help and/or join the team - additional compensation, including, compounding of this will be provided.

The hope (though not necessary) is that the winner will be incentivized to continue contributing - this bounty has the option to become a full or regular part-time position as a lead dev and much larger stake holder.

# Flexibility for creativeness:
The point of the bounty and the ideas mentioned are to serve as guides. The winner will be the provider that can build something that accomplishes the goal and is the most "user friendly" - i.e. creating side benefits from whatever is creative that increases user interaction and is positively reinforcing vs. punitive will be deemed as more likely to win - however, if a punitive approach is deemed as more effective, so long as it doesn't detract users to the point of preventing growth - that will win.


# Examples:
**Some examples of the potential bounties include large or small, technical or non-technical projects.**

* Smart Contracts that increase fate price/tvl
* Rewards tracker based on commitment w/ bonus
